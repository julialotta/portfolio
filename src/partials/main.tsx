          Hi! I'm happy to see you here. This portfolio isn't really done yet,
          but I'm working on it! I'm developing this website in React. It will
          be my first React project and I'm super excited to learn how it works.
          The funny thing is that I already kind of know React Native. Which
          might sound weird, but Iâ€™m developing a game application for both iOS
          and Android, and since I kind of know Javascript I thought React
          Native was the smarter choice for me. <br />
          I really love React Native actually, so hopefully React will treat me
          just as good.
          <br />
          <br />
          Anyways, better go back to coding now.
          <br />
          See you soon!
