        Hi! I'm happy to see you here. This portfolio isn't really done yet, but
        I'm working on it!
      </h4>
      <p>
        I'm developing this website in React. It will be my first React project
        and I'm super excited to learn how it works. The funny thing is that I
        already kind of know React Native. Which might sound weird, but Iâ€™m
        developing a game application for both iOS and Android, and since I kind
        of know Javascript I thought React Native was the smarter choice for me.{" "}
        <br />
        I really love React Native actually, so hopefully React will treat me
        just as good.
        <br />
        <br />
        Anyways, better go back to coding now.
        <br />
        See you soon!
